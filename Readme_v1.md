# **Project Module 3 - Diamond Price Prediction Challenge üîÆüí∂üíé**

The main reason for this project is to apply **Machine Learning** techniques and data analysis in a real-world context, where diamond valuation is influenced by some factors; by developing an accurate and robust predictive model capable of estimating the price of diamonds based on a set of relevant features.


## 1. Project description üëá
> Project Module 3 - Part time Sept 2023 - [Ironhack Madrid - Data Analytics Bootcamp](https://www.ironhack.com/es-en/data-analytics)

This competition has been created specifically in in [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ihdatamadpt0923projectm3/overview)for the students of the Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp, providing an opportunity to apply Machine Learning concepts and master skills related to.

 **The main challenge** was getting the lowest **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error) as the chosen evaluation metric.

## **3. Minimal Functional App ‚öôÔ∏è**

To know the purpose of our visualization, **first** we must know the audience we will present it to, in order to prepare our visualization and give the right message with the right words.

For this case, I developed a fictional character for the **Profile Persona** named Lucia, which the visualization will allow her to **take decisions about** what skills should be trained for **and** what countries offers the best for her professional development.



## **4. Main conclusions üìÅ**

With this report, Lucia made her decision of getting the tools and trainings to enhance her business and sales background to get an entry in the Tech Market as a Data Analyst.

What motivates her the most is staying in Spain because of the high probabilities to achive her goals, along with keeping on touch with family and friends.

This is just the beginning of Lucia professional growth. For more details, [**click here**](https://public.tableau.com/views/Readme_mdProjectM2DataScience/1_Overview?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) to interact with the dynamic dashboard.
